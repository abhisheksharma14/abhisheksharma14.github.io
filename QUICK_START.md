# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Your Portfolio is Ready!

Everything is set up. Just follow these 3 simple steps:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Repository name: `portfolio-website`
3. Make it **PUBLIC** (required for free hosting)
4. **Don't** check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code (1 minute)

Copy your GitHub username from the page, then run:

```bash
cd /Users/abhishek.sharma/private/portfolio-website

# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio-website.git

git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Your Site is Live! (2-3 minutes)

1. GitHub will automatically deploy your site
2. Go to your repository → **Actions** tab
3. Watch the deployment (green checkmark when done)
4. Your portfolio will be live at:
   ```
   https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/portfolio-website/
   ```
